# Brain-Tumor-Detection
 A semantic segmentation project

## Instructions:

To open the ipynb file in google colab first open google colab and then select the "GitHub" Tab. Then enter the following URL:
https://github.com/angela-maennel/Brain-Tumor-Detection
you should be able to select the ipynb file to open it. However it will not compile since the data is missing. To be able to run the file you will need to import the zip file from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation) and then change the address given in the first code block, where the file is extracted.


## About the Data:

- Data can be found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation

- Dataset used in:

Mateusz Buda, AshirbaniSaha, Maciej A. Mazurowski "Association of genomic subtypes of lower-grade gliomas with shape features automatically extracted by a deep learning algorithm." Computers in Biology and Medicine, 2019.

and

Maciej A. Mazurowski, Kal Clark, Nicholas M. Czarnek, Parisa Shamsesfandabadi, Katherine B. Peters, Ashirbani Saha "Radiogenomics of lower-grade glioma: algorithmically-assessed tumor shape is associated with tumor genomic subtypes and patient outcomes in a multi-institutional study with The Cancer Genome Atlas data." Journal of Neuro-Oncology, 2017.

- Additional information on the data: 

This dataset contains brain MR images togImaging Archive (TCIA). They correspond to 110 patients included in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) lower-grade glioma collection with at least fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence and genomic cluster data available.
